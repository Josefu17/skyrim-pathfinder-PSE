## Q1:
The navigation service must not have a cache or a connection to the DB. Can the web backend instead load results into the DB and check whether a route has already been requested so that it can then be loaded from the DB?

### A1:


## Q2:
How does gitlab-ci service and artifacts work?

### A2:
**Services:**
- Docker containers that run alongside job's main container
- Provide additional functionality or dependencies that the job needs, such as databases, caching systems, or APIs.
- Share the same network with job's main container, therefore can communicate with it via `localhost`
- How to use:
  - With `services` keyword. Example:
    ```yaml
      test-job: 
        image: python:3.13
        services:
          - postgres:latest
    ```
**Artifacts:**
- Files or directories that are generated by a job that are saved or passed to other jobs.
- How to use:
  - **Passing Artifacts Between Jobs:**
      ```yaml
      stages:
        - build
        - test
    
      build-job:
        stage: build
        script:
          - echo "Compiling code..."
          - mkdir dist && echo "Build complete" > dist/build.txt
        artifacts:
          paths:
            - dist/
    
      test-job:
        stage: test
        dependencies:
          - build-job
        script:
          - cat dist/build.txt
      ```
- **build-job** saves the `dist/` directory as an artifact.
- **test-job** can access the artifact because it depends on `build-job`.


## Q3:
Where is "${CI_DEPENDENCY_PROXY_GROUP_IMAGE_PREFIX}" set?

### A3:
It's set in the predefined CI/CD GitLab variables (We can not see it in GitLab)
